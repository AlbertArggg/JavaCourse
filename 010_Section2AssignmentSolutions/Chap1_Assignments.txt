Chapter 1: Assignments

1)	write a program that asks the user for his first and last name, once the user has input the values, 
	print out a statement welcoming the user by stating his full name. 

2) 	Write a program that asks the user for a number between 3-10. If the user's input is outside the given
	range, inform the user of his error and allow him to input a diffrent value. Once that value is acceptable,
	calculate the addition of every number from 1 to the given input. 
	example: user input = 5, output = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
	    	 user input = 7, output = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7

3) 	Write a program that will pick a random number between any two values and ask the user to guess that number.
	if the user's input is less than or greater than the requested value, inform the user
	otherwise, if the input is equal to the requested value, inform the user that he has won and terminate the program.
